The source code originally for the Monte-Carlo model B (in V.Vuorinen et al. Safety Science Volume 130, October 2020, 104866). The code is written in Python.  
Source code modified and extended by TU/e students H.R. Chen, M.A. Eikens and J.E.M. Peters.

The tool can be run with testSimulation.py.

The code produces the following output:
-video_{simulationID}_{seed}.mkv
-storeMap.png  
	Layout of the latest simulation, temporary file

In the simFigures folder:
-simFigure_{simulationID}_{seed}_{step}.png
	Snapshot of the store layout
