The create_geometry.py script depends on packages blockmesher and roomgenerator which can be both found from
bitbucket

case: create_turbulence
    -Initializes the background turbulence field. The forcing is controlled through fvOptions
    -the parameter A in fvOptions controls the background velocity magnitude and T controls the time scale
    -No refinments around humans are used in this case to allow longer time steps

case: cough
    -Similar to create_turbulence but contains refinements around human(s). 
    -The cough is modelled as a scalar for now
